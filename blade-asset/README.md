# Blade Asset Pipeline

This is an abstract library for defininig the pipeline of asset processing.
It's tightly integrated with [Choir](https://github.com/kvark/choir) but otherwise doesn't know about GPUs and such.

Watch the [RustGamedev June 2023 talk](https://youtu.be/1DiA3OYqvqU) about it. See [the slides](https://hackmd.io/@kvark/blade-asset-pipeline#/).
